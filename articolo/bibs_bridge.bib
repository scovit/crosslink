  abstract = {Quantitative spatial distributions of ribosomes (S2-YFP) and RNA polymerase
	(RNAP; β'-yGFP) in live Escherichia coli are measured by superresolution
	fluorescence microscopy. In moderate growth conditions, nucleoid-ribosome
	segregation is strong, and RNAP localizes to the nucleoid lobes.
	The mean copy numbers per cell are 4600 RNAPs and 55,000 ribosomes.
	Only 10-15\% of the ribosomes lie within the densest part of the
	nucleoid lobes, and at most 4\% of the RNAPs lie in the two ribosome-rich
	endcaps. The predominant observed diffusion coefficient of ribosomes
	is D(ribo) = 0.04 µm(2) s(-1), attributed to free mRNA being translated
	by one or more 70S ribosomes. We find no clear evidence of subdiffusion,
	as would arise from tethering of ribosomes to the DNA. The degree
	of DNA-ribosome segregation strongly suggests that in E. coli most
	translation occurs on free mRNA transcripts that have diffused into
	the ribosome-rich regions. Both RNAP and ribosome radial distributions
	extend to the cytoplasmic membrane, consistent with the transertion
	hypothesis. However, few if any RNAP copies lie near the membrane
	of the endcaps. This suggests that if transertion occurs, it exerts
	a direct radially expanding force on the nucleoid, but not a direct
	axially expanding force.},

  abstract ={Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein–DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a “programmable” computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental studies have revealed that bacteria, such as C.
	crescentus, show a remarkable spatial ordering of their chromosome.
	A strong linear correlation has been found between the position of
	genes on the chromosomal map and their spatial position in the cellular
	volume. We show that this correlation can be explained by a purely
	geometrical model. Namely, self-avoidance of DNA, specific positioning
	of one or few DNA loci (such as origin or terminus) together with
	the action of DNA compaction proteins (that organize the chromosome
	into topological domains) are sufficient to get a linear arrangement
	of the chromosome along the cell axis. We develop a Monte-Carlo method
	that allows us to test our model numerically and to analyze the dependence
	of the spatial ordering on various physiologically relevant parameters.
	We show that the proposed geometrical ordering mechanism is robust
	and universal (i.e. does not depend on specific bacterial details).
	The geometrical mechanism should work in all bacteria that have compacted
	chromosomes with spatially fixed regions. We use our model to make

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli the genome must be compacted approximately 1,000-fold
	to be contained in a cellular structure termed the nucleoid. It is
	proposed that the structure of the nucleoid is determined by a balance
	of multiple compaction forces and one major expansion force. The
	latter is mediated by transertion, a coupling of transcription, translation,
	and translocation of nascent membrane proteins and/or exported proteins.
	In supporting this notion, it has been shown consistently that inhibition
	of transertion by the translation inhibitor chloramphenicol results
	in nucleoid condensation due to the compaction forces that remain
	active in the cell. Our previous study showed that during optimal
	growth, RNA polymerase is concentrated into transcription foci or
	"factories," analogous to the eukaryotic nucleolus, indicating that
	transcription and RNA polymerase distribution affect the nucleoid
	structure. However, the interpretation of the role of transcription
	in the structure of the nucleoid is complicated by the fact that
	transcription is implicated in both compacting forces and the expansion
	force. In this work, we used a new approach to further examine the
	effect of transcription, specifically from rRNA operons, on the structure
	of the nucleoid, when the major expansion force was eliminated. Our
	results showed that transcription is necessary for the chloramphenicol-induced
	nucleoid compaction. Further, an active transcription from multiple
	rRNA operons in chromosome is critical for the compaction of nucleoid
	induced by inhibition of translation. All together, our data demonstrated
	that transcription of rRNA operons is a key mechanism affecting genome
	compaction and nucleoid structure.},

	highly condensed into a structure called the nucleoid. Despite the

	Here, we present the first high-resolution chromosome conformation
	capture-based molecular analysis of the spatial organization of the
	Escherichia coli nucleoid during rapid growth in rich medium and
	following an induced amino acid starvation that promotes the stringent

	domains in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, we observe an increased
	number of interactions within the origin domain and significant clustering
	of SeqA-binding sequences, suggesting a role for SeqA in clustering
	of newly replicated chromosomes. By contrast, 'histone-like' protein
	(i.e. Fis, IHF and H-NS) -binding sites did not cluster, and their
	role in global nucleoid organization does not manifest through the
	mediation of chromosomal contacts. Finally, genes that were downregulated
	after induction of the stringent response were spatially clustered,
	indicating that transcription in E. coli occurs at transcription
	foci.},

	consists of hundreds of DNA loops, shaped in part by non-specific
	DNA bridging proteins such as histone-like nucleoid structuring protein
	(H-NS), leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and SMC (structural
	maintenance of chromosomes) proteins. We have developed an optical
	tweezers instrument that can independently handle two DNA molecules,

	is dynamically organized between two DNA molecules in register with
	their helical pitch. Our optical tweezers also allow us to carry
	out dynamic force spectroscopy on non-specific DNA binding proteins
	and thereby to determine an energy landscape for the H-NS-DNA interaction.
	Our results explain how the bacterial nucleoid can be effectively
	compacted and organized, but be dynamic in nature and accessible

	from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that
	abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial
	relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed
	a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions,
	and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid
	genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features
	of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies
	new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual
	chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation
	that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction
	between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are
	anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA
	genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where
	chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional
	model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the
	interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

	despite a very long divergence period. We have assessed the forces
	limiting bacterial genome plasticity in Escherichia coli by measuring
	the respective effect of altering different parameters, including
	DNA replication, compositional skew of replichores, coordination
	of gene expression with DNA replication, replication-associated gene
	dosage, and chromosome organization into macrodomains. Chromosomes
	were rearranged by large inversions. Changes in the compositional
	skew of replichores, in the coordination of gene expression with
	DNA replication or in the replication-associated gene dosage have
	only a moderate effect on cell physiology because large rearrangements
	inverting the orientation of several hundred genes inside a replichore
	are only slightly detrimental. By contrast, changing the balance
	between the two replication arms has a more drastic effect, and the
	recombinational rescue of replication forks is required for cell
	viability when one of the chromosome arms is less than half than
	the other one. Macrodomain organization also appears to be a major
	factor restricting chromosome plasticity, and two types of inverted
	configurations severely affect the cell cycle. First, the disruption
	of the Ter macrodomain with replication forks merging far from the
	normal replichore junction provoked chromosome segregation defects.
	The second major problematic configurations resulted from inversions
	between Ori and Right macrodomains, which perturb nucleoid distribution
	and early steps of cytokinesis. Consequences for the control of the
	bacterial cell cycle and for the evolution of bacterial chromosome

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genes on the chromosome are organized in a fixed
	order, the spatial correlations in transcription have not been systematically
	evaluated. We used a combination of genomic and signal processing
	techniques to investigate the properties of transcription in the
	genome of Escherichia coli K12 as a function of the position of genes
	on the chromosome. RESULTS: Spectral analysis of transcriptional
	series revealed the existence of statistically significant patterns
	in the spatial series of transcriptional activity. These patterns
	could be classified into three categories: short-range, of up to
	16 kilobases (kb); medium-range, over 100-125 kb; and long-range,
	over 600-800 kb. We show that the significant similarities in gene
	activities extend beyond the length of an operon and that local patterns
	of coexpression are dependent on DNA supercoiling. Unlike short-range
	patterns, the formation of medium and long-range transcriptional
	patterns does not strictly depend on the level of DNA supercoiling.
	The long-range patterns appear to correlate with the patterns of
	distribution of DNA gyrase on the bacterial chromosome. CONCLUSIONS:
	Localization of structural components in the transcriptional signal
	revealed an asymmetry in the distribution of transcriptional patterns
	along the bacterial chromosome. The demonstration that spatial patterns
	of transcription could be modulated pharmacologically and genetically,
	along with the identification of molecular correlates of transcriptional
	patterns, offer for the first time strong evidence of physiologically
	determined higher-order organization of transcription in the bacterial

	Flanking regions, meanwhile, separate. Thus, the two identified regions
	comprise specialized late-splitting intersister connections or snaps.
	Sister snap loci separate simultaneously in both snap regions, concomitant
	with a major global nucleoid reorganization that results in emergence
	of a bilobed nucleoid morphology. Split snap loci move rapidly apart
	to a separation distance comparable with one-half the length of the
	nucleoid. Concomitantly, at already split positions, sister loci
	undergo further separation to a comparable distance. The overall
	consequence of these and other effects is that thus far replicated
	sister chromosomes become spatially separated (individualized) into
	the two nucleoid lobes, while the terminus region (and likely, all
	unreplicated portions of the chromosome) moves to midcell. These
	and other findings imply that segregation of Escherichia coli sister
	chromosomes is not a smooth continuous process but involves at least
	one and likely, two major global transition(s). The presented patterns
	further suggest that accumulation of internal intranucleoid forces
	and constraining of these forces by snaps play central roles in global
	chromosome dynamics. They are consistent with and supportive of our
	previous proposals that individualization of sisters in E. coli is

	expression in Escherichia coli, which affect DNA conformation by
	bending, wrapping and bridging the DNA. Two of these--H-NS and Fis--bind
	to specific DNA sequences and structures. Because of their importance
	to global gene expression, the binding of these NAPs to the DNA was
	previously investigated on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-chip. However,
	variation in their binding profiles across the growth phase and the
	genome-scale nature of their impact on gene expression remain poorly
	understood. Here, we present a genome-scale investigation of H-NS
	and Fis binding to the E. coli chromosome using chromatin immunoprecipitation
	combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). By performing
	our experiments under multiple time-points during growth in rich
	media, we show that the binding regions of the two proteins are mutually
	exclusive under our experimental conditions. H-NS binds to significantly
	longer tracts of DNA than Fis, consistent with the linear spread
	of H-NS binding from high- to surrounding lower-affinity sites; the
	length of binding regions is associated with the degree of transcriptional
	repression imposed by H-NS. For Fis, a majority of binding events
	do not lead to differential expression of the proximal gene; however,
	it has a significant indirect effect on gene expression partly through
	its effects on the expression of other transcription factors. We
	propose that direct transcriptional regulation by Fis is associated
	with the interaction of tandem arrays of Fis molecules to the DNA
	and possible DNA bending, particularly at operon-upstream regions.
	Our study serves as a proof-of-principle for the use of ChIP-seq
	for global DNA-binding proteins in bacteria, which should become

	with polymer length. The free-energy cost of linking of polymer rings
	is therefore strongly dependent on degree of self-avoidance, i.e.,
	on intersegment excluded volume. Scaling arguments and numerical
	data are used to determine the free-energy cost of fixed linking
	number in both the fluctuation and large-Ca regimes; for ideal random
	walks, for |Ca|>N;{1/4} , the free energy of catenation is found

	interactions between segments are present, the free energy rapidly
	approaches a linear dependence on Gauss linking (dF/dCa approximately

	These results are used to show that condensation of long entangled
	polymers along their length, so as to increase excluded volume while
	decreasing number of statistical segments, can drive disentanglement
	if a mechanism is present to permit topology change. For chromosomal
	DNA molecules, lengthwise condensation is therefore an effective

	chromatids. The results for mean-square catenation are also used
	to provide a simple approximate estimate for the "knotting length,"

	used to describe chromatin folding. However, none of the proposed
	models gives a satisfactory explanation of experimental data. In
	particularly, they ignore that each chromosome occupies a confined
	space, i.e., the chromosome territory. Here, we present a polymer
	model that is able to describe key properties of chromatin over length
	scales ranging from 0.5 to 75 Mb. This random loop (RL) model assumes
	a self-avoiding random walk folding of the polymer backbone and defines
	a probability P for 2 monomers to interact, creating loops of a broad
	size range. Model predictions are compared with systematic measurements
	of chromatin folding of the q-arms of chromosomes 1 and 11. The RL
	model can explain our observed data and suggests that on the tens-of-megabases
	length scale P is small, i.e., 10-30 loops per 100 Mb. This is sufficient
	to enforce folding inside the confined space of a chromosome territory.
	On the 0.5- to 3-Mb length scale chromatin compaction differs in
	different subchromosomal domains. This aspect of chromatin structure
	is incorporated in the RL model by introducing heterogeneity along
	the fiber contour length due to different local looping probabilities.
	The RL model creates a quantitative and predictive framework for
	the identification of nuclear components that are responsible for
	chromatin-chromatin interactions and determine the 3-dimensional

	relevant for the biophysics of chromatin. We then discuss properties
	of the fractal globule that make it an attractive model for chromatin
	organization inside a cell. Next, we connect the fractal globule

	approximately 1000 times compacted in the living cell, where it occupies
	approximately 15% of the cellular volume. The genome is organized
	in a way that facilitates chromosome maintenance and processing.
	Despite huge efforts, until recently little has been known about
	how the chromosome is organized within cells, where replication takes
	place, and how DNA is segregated before cell division. New techniques
	for labeling genetic loci and molecular machines are allowing the
	simultaneous tracking of genetic loci and such machines in living
	cells over time. These studies reveal remarkable organization, yet
	a highly dynamic flux of genetic loci and macromolecules. It seems
	likely that the cellular positioning of chromosomal loci is the outcome
	of the formation of two chromosome arms (replichores) by replication,
	followed by sequential chromosome segregation, rather than from the
	presence of cellular positioning markers.},

	Such interplay is the major driving force of genome structure or

	create complex higher-level organizational features that are adaptive
	because they favor the interplay between the processes. The surprising
	result of selection for genome organization is that gene repertoires
