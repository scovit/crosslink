title = {Quantitative model for gene regulation by lambda phage repressor},
volume = {79}, 
number = {4}, 
pages = {1129-1133}, 
year = {1982}, 
abstract ={A statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to
                  account for the cooperative interactions of the
                  bacteriophage lambda repressor with the lambda right
                  operator. The model incorporates a general theory
                  for quantitatively interpreting cooperative
                  site-specific equilibrium binding data. Values for
                  all interaction parameters of the model have been
                  evaluated at 37 degrees C, 0.2 M KCl, from results
                  of DNase protection experiments in vitro
                  [A. D. Johnson, B. J. Meyer, & M. Ptashne,
                  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 76,
                  5061-5065]. With these values, the model predicts
                  repression curves at the divergent promoters PR and
                  PRM that control transcription of genes coding for
                  the regulatory proteins cro and repressor,
                  respectively. At physiological repressor
                  concentrations, repression at PR is predicted to be
                  nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain
                  highly active. The results demonstrate the
                  importance of cooperative interactions between
                  repressor dimers bound to the adjacent operator
                  sites OR1 and OR2 in maintaining a stable lysogenic
                  state and in allowing efficient switchover to the
                  lytic state during induction.},

	the scaling properties of chromatin folding reported experimentally
	in different cellular systems, the fractal state of chromatin, the

	"fractal-globule" model, but only as one of many possible transient

abstract ={To fit within the confines of the cell, bacterial chromosomes are highly condensed into a structure called the nucleoid. Despite the high degree of compaction in the nucleoid, the genome remains accessible to essential biological processes, such as replication and transcription. Here, we present the first high-resolution chromosome conformation capture-based molecular analysis of the spatial organization of the Escherichia coli nucleoid during rapid growth in rich medium and following an induced amino acid starvation that promotes the stringent response. Our analyses identify the presence of origin and terminus domains in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, we observe an increased number of interactions within the origin domain and significant clustering of SeqA-binding sequences, suggesting a role for SeqA in clustering of newly replicated chromosomes. By contrast, ‘histone-like’ protein (i.e. Fis, IHF and H-NS) -binding sites did not cluster, and their role in global nucleoid organization does not manifest through the mediation of chromosomal contacts. Finally, genes that were downregulated after induction of the stringent response were spatially clustered, indicating that transcription in E. coli occurs at transcription foci.},

abstract ={H-NS and Lsr2 are nucleoid-associated proteins from
                  Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria,
                  respectively, that play an important role in the
                  silencing of horizontally acquired foreign DNA that
                  is more AT-rich than the resident genome. Despite
                  the fact that Lsr2 and H-NS proteins are dissimilar
                  in sequence and structure, they serve apparently
                  similar functions and can functionally complement
                  one another. The mechanism by which these xenogeneic
                  silencers selectively target AT-rich DNA has been
                  enigmatic. We performed high-resolution protein
                  binding microarray analysis to simultaneously assess
                  the binding preference of H-NS and Lsr2 for all
                  possible 8-base sequences. Concurrently, we
                  performed a detailed structure-function relationship
                  analysis of their C-terminal DNA binding domains by
                  NMR. Unexpectedly, we found that H-NS and Lsr2 use a
                  common DNA binding mechanism where a short loop
                  containing a “Q/RGR” motif selectively interacts
                  with the DNA minor groove, where the highest
                  affinity is for AT-rich sequences that lack
                  A-tracts. Mutations of the Q/RGR motif abolished DNA
                  binding activity. Netropsin, a DNA minor
                  groove-binding molecule effectively outcompeted H-NS
                  and Lsr2 for binding to AT-rich sequences. These
                  results provide a unified molecular mechanism to
                  explain findings related to xenogeneic silencing
                  proteins, including their lack of apparent sequence
                  specificity but preference for AT-rich
                  sequences. Our findings also suggest that structural
                  information contained within the DNA minor groove is
                  deciphered by xenogeneic silencing proteins to
                  distinguish genetic material that is self from
                  nonself.},

	The mechanisms for migration are illustrated using a simple kinetic

	We also examine the steady-state stretch of DNA chains as a function

	to increase with decreasing channel width, independent of molecular
	weight; this is fairly well explained using a simple blob picture.},

  abstract = {Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) are global regulators of gene
	expression in Escherichia coli, which affect DNA conformation by
	bending, wrapping and bridging the DNA. Two of these—H-NS and Fis—bind
	to specific DNA sequences and structures. Because of their importance
	to global gene expression, the binding of these NAPs to the DNA was
	previously investigated on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-chip. However,
	variation in their binding profiles across the growth phase and the
	genome-scale nature of their impact on gene expression remain poorly
	understood. Here, we present a genome-scale investigation of H-NS
	and Fis binding to the E. coli chromosome using chromatin immunoprecipitation
	combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). By performing
	our experiments under multiple time-points during growth in rich
	media, we show that the binding regions of the two proteins are mutually
	exclusive under our experimental conditions. H-NS binds to significantly
	longer tracts of DNA than Fis, consistent with the linear spread
	of H-NS binding from high- to surrounding lower-affinity sites; the
	length of binding regions is associated with the degree of transcriptional
	repression imposed by H-NS. For Fis, a majority of binding events
	do not lead to differential expression of the proximal gene; however,
	it has a significant indirect effect on gene expression partly through
	its effects on the expression of other transcription factors. We
	propose that direct transcriptional regulation by Fis is associated
	with the interaction of tandem arrays of Fis molecules to the DNA
	and possible DNA bending, particularly at operon-upstream regions.
	Our study serves as a proof-of-principle for the use of ChIP-seq
	for global DNA-binding proteins in bacteria, which should become
	significantly more economical and feasible with the development of
	multiplexing techniques.},

	DNA electrophoresis in complicated geometries. The proposed numerical
	scheme is composed of three parts: (1) a bead-spring Brownian dynamics
	(BD) simulation, (2) an iterative solver-enhanced finite element
	method (FEM) for the electric field, and (3) the connection algorithm
	between FEM and BD. A target-induced searching algorithm is developed
	to quickly address the electric field in the complex geometry which
	is discretized into unstructured finite element meshes. We also develop
	a method to use the hard-sphere interaction algorithm proposed by
	Heyes and Melrose [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 46, 1 (1993)] in
	FEM. To verify the accuracy of our numerical schemes, our method
	is applied to the problem of lambda-DNA deformation around an isolated
	cylindrical obstacle for which the analytical solution of the electric
	field is available and experimental data exist. We compare our schemes
	with an analytical approach and there is a good agreement between
	the two. We expect that the present numerical method will be useful
	for the design of future microfluidic devices to stretch and/or separate
	DNA.},

	the chromosomes has remained unclear because of limited knowledge

	pressure required to hold the chromosome at this size is a thousand-fold
	smaller than the surrounding turgor pressure inside the cell. Furthermore,
	by manipulation of molecular crowding conditions (entropic forces),
	we were able to observe in real time fast (approximately 10 s), abrupt,
	reversible, and repeatable compaction–decompaction cycles of individual
	chromosomes in confinement. In contrast, we observed much slower

  abstract = {We use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate
	the physical principles underlying subdiffusive motion of a polymer.
	Specifically, we examine the consequences of confinement, self-interaction,
	viscoelasticity, and random waiting on monomer motion, as these physical
	phenomena may be relevant to the behavior of biological macromolecules
	in vivo. We find that neither confinement nor self-interaction alter
	the fundamental Rouse mode relaxations of a polymer. However, viscoelasticity,
	modeled by fractional Langevin motion, and random waiting, modeled
	with a continuous time random walk, lead to significant and distinct
	deviations from the classic polymer-dynamics model. Our results provide
	diagnostic tools--the monomer mean square displacement scaling and
	the velocity autocorrelation function--that can be applied to experimental
	data to determine the underlying mechanism for subdiffusive motion
	of a polymer.},

abstract ={The stochasticity of chromosome organization was investigated by fluorescently labeling genetic loci in live Escherichia coli cells. In spite of the common assumption that the chromosome is well modeled by an unstructured polymer, measurements of the locus distributions reveal that the E. coli chromosome is precisely organized into a nucleoid filament with a linear order. Loci in the body of the nucleoid show a precision of positioning within the cell of better than 10 percent of the cell length. The precision of interlocus distance of genomically-proximate loci was better than 4 percent of the cell length. The measured dependence of the precision of interlocus distance on genomic distance singles out intranucleoid interactions as the mechanism responsible for chromosome organization. From the magnitude of the variance, we infer the existence of an as-yet uncharacterized higher-order DNA organization in bacteria. We demonstrate that both the stochastic and average structure of the nucleoid is captured by a fluctuating elastic filament model.},
